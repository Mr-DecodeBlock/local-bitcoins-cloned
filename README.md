TDD

Pitch: Given localbitcoins.com recent removal of cash as a payment options and introduce KYC, it has driven some of its users who value privacy away from the platform.

This project aims to build a simple bulletin board for local echangers (Maker) looking to advertise thier services. A Maker will be able to signup/login and 'post' a trade.

Each post will contain but will not be limited to the following:
- Min amount
- Max amount
- Location
- Contact Info
- Trade Terms
- Commission percent

Once a Maker creates a post it will show up in the home page under either "Sell" or "Buy" section.

A user (Taker) visiting the site will be able to choose the 'post'. Upon clicking the 'Buy' or 'Sell' button, a Deal will be initiated where the Maker and Taker could direct message each other.

After Deal is completed (successfully) 1. both the Maker and Taker will be prompted to give feedback and 2. Data such as amount will be added to the landing page. On an incomplete deal, both Maker and Taker will also be prompted to leave feedback.
